This is an anime website project that I have built for the n-th time as it keeps breaking down. I am currently aware that certain anime return the wrong anime (off by a long shot). I am finding alternative fixes to it but the sources have been down unfortunately.

## Getting Started

To install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
